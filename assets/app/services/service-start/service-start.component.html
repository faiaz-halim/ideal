        An eSafety (or pink slip) inspection report verifies that your vehicle is safe
        and ready for the road. Most light vehicles more than 5 years old will require
        an eSafety check before they can be registered in NSW. Your registration renewal
        papers will state whether or not you need an inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will send the result of the test directly to Roads and Maritime Services.
